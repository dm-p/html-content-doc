The documentation site has been in need of some TLC for a while now, as it has been hard to update and maintain. As we have a new version that needs to ship soon, this is no longer the case! ðŸŽ‰

HTML Content is a relatively stable visual in terms of how it works, so very little caretaking is needed. The site was originally built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which has been perfectly fine, but due to various architectural reasons from my end, the process to maintain things was very complicated and I've been wanting to improve it for some time. As I've been using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for [Deneb](https://deneb-viz.github.io/)'s documentation site for the last 3 years or so and have been very happy with it, I thought it would be a good idea to migrate this site over to Docusaurus as well. This way, I can use the same tools and processes for both sites, and it will be easier to maintain in the future.

I'll be back soon with some news about our forthcoming visual update, but just wanted to say hi, as it's been a while!

All the best, and thanks for using HTML Content!
