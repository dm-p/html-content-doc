# Stylesheet

The **Stylesheet** property menu allows you to provide CSS at the top level, rather than having to manage styling in-line or contextually.

If you're using [Granularity](data-roles#granularity) (which uses div elements to separate rows), then this allows you to do things like change the display behavior to create alternate layouts.
