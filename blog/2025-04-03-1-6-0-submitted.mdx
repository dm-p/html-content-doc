We have a new versions of **HTML Content** and **HTML Content (lite)** that have been submitted to AppSource for approval ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

{/* truncate */}

I've recently been asked if HTML Content could support markdown, so I took the opportunity to add this in. As such, we've added a new option called **Renderer** to the **Content formatting** property pane, which allows you to choose between HTML and Markdown rendering.

If you select **Markdown**, your content will be pre-processed for any valid markdown syntax, before being passed to the HTML renderer. This means that you can use markdown syntax for things like headings, lists, and links, and it will be rendered correctly in the visual. And because this is a pre-processor, you can still use HTML tags within your markdown content, and they will be rendered as expected.

Full details of the release are available in the [Change Log](/docs/change-log) if you want to read more about this.

I expect that because **HTML Content** is uncertified, it will appear much faster than **HTML Content (lite)** will do. However both editions will likely have a lengthy deployment time due to global rollout, so as normal, there is a [standalone version available from the repository](https://github.com/dm-p/powerbi-visuals-html-content/releases/tag/1.6.0.0) if you want to give it a spin ahead of time.

Thanks to everyone for your continued support and feedback, and I hope you enjoy the new features!
